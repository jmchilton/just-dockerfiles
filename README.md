# just-dockerfiles

This project is an integrated test framework - tying together Jenkins
testing and reporting with simple, unstructured jobs driven by Docker
(Dockerfiles, Docker images, or docker-compose set ups), structured
YAML metadata about tests.

Because this project is in its infancy, the structure of tests and the
project itself will change greatly over the coming months.
